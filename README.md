**Smart Meal Optimization for Balanced Nutrition**

Mealy is an intelligent meal planning API that uses advanced mathematical optimization to create perfectly balanced meals based on your calorie and macronutrient goals.

## What It Does

Mealy solves a complex nutritional puzzle: given a list of available foods, it calculates the exact portions needed to hit your target calories, macronutrients (carbs, protein, fat), and micronutrients‚Äîall while ensuring realistic, practical serving sizes.

### How It Works

1. **Select Your Foods**: Choose from a diverse database of whole foods including proteins (chicken, salmon, tofu), carbs (rice, oats, quinoa), healthy fats (avocado, olive oil, almonds), and vegetables
2. **Set Your Goals**: Specify your target calories and macro percentages (or use smart defaults)
3. **Get Optimized Meals**: Receive precise portion sizes that balance all your nutritional targets simultaneously

The optimization engine uses **weighted least squares** with intelligent constraints to find the ideal combination of foods that:
- Hits your calorie target accurately
- Balances macronutrients according to your percentages (e.g., 40% carbs, 30% protein, 30% fat)
- Includes adequate vegetables for micronutrients
- Provides realistic portions (10g‚Äì400g per ingredient)
- Considers 13+ essential micronutrients for longevity

## Key Benefits

### üéØ **Precision Nutrition**
- Achieve macro targets within 1-2% accuracy
- No more guessing or manual calculations
- Mathematical optimization ensures the best possible balance

### ü•ó **Prevents Extreme Results**
- Smart bounds prevent unrealistic portions (no more 878g of carrots!)
- Normalized weighting ensures fair balancing across all nutrients
- Minimum 10g per ingredient prevents trace amounts
- Maximum 400g per ingredient keeps portions realistic

### üßÆ **Science-Based Algorithm**
- Uses normalized weights (`w/t¬≤`) to equalize percentage errors
- Treats a 1% error in fat the same as a 1% error in carbs
- Considers both macronutrients and micronutrients simultaneously
- Decoupled vegetable constraint prevents circular dependencies

### üîß **Flexible & Customizable**
- Set custom calorie targets (default: 700 kcal per meal)
- Adjust macro percentages to your diet (e.g., 50/25/25 for low-fat)
- Choose from diverse food options including plant-based proteins
- Works with any combination of available foods

### ‚ö° **Fast & Reliable**
- RESTful API built with FastAPI
- Instant optimization results
- CORS-enabled for easy frontend integration
- Consistent, reproducible results

## Technical Highlights

### Optimization Approach
The app uses **scipy's least squares solver** (`lsq_linear`) with:
- **Matrix A**: Nutritional content per 100g for each food
- **Vector b**: Your target nutrient values
- **Weight normalization**: `weight / (target¬≤)` for fair percentage-based penalties
- **Bounds**: 10‚Äì400g per ingredient for practical portions

### Nutrient Tracking
Each meal is optimized across 17+ nutritional parameters:
- **Macros**: Calories, carbs, protein, fat, fiber
- **Minerals**: Magnesium, potassium, selenium, zinc
- **Vitamins**: D, K2, folate, B12, C, E
- **Other**: Omega-3 EPA/DHA, choline

### Food Database
Curated whole-food database with per-100g nutrition data sourced from USDA:
- **Proteins**: Chicken, salmon, eggs, beef, tofu
- **Carbs**: White rice, sweet potato, oats, quinoa
- **Fats**: Avocado, almonds, olive oil
- **Vegetables**: Broccoli, spinach, carrots, kale, bell peppers, cauliflower, tomato
- **Fruits**: Banana, blueberries
